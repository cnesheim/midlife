        text: "A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious scientist, Karl Koopman suffered a severe fretboard injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempted to force him to build a guitar of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Koopman develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, MIDLIFE Industries. He uses the suit and guitar skills to protect the world as Iron Axe Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Koopman eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Axe Man.",

        text: "Doug is a \"merry fellow\" living in a small valley close to the Mississioppi river, where he wanders and explores music at his leisure. Several of the valley's mysterious residents, including the \"River-woman's daughter\" Celste, the malevolent tree-spirit Old Stevie Wonder, the Funky-folk and a Groove-wight, attempt to capture Doug for their own ends, but quail at the power of Dougs's talent, which defeats their musical boredom and commands them to return to their rhythmic existence. At the end of the song, Grimm captures and marries Celeste. Throughout the poem, Doug is unconcerned by the attempts to capture him and brushes them off with the power in his solos.",

After losing his beloved Fender Jazz Bass Special to a burglar, grief- stricken Mike vowed to use his incredible abilities to protect the funk as the Amazing Groove-Man. Mikeâ€™s trials taught him an invaluable lesson: with great funkiness, there must also come great responsibility.",

        text: "A massive dose of gamma radiation transformed the brilliant but meek drummer Christian Nesheim's DNA, awakening the hidden, adrenaline-fed hero in his genes... NESH! A hero of few words and incredible rhythm, the NESH has long been pursued by those who want to use his immense beats for their own purposes, or by those who thought the Beat Master's groove was too dangerous to be controlled. Now, as a member of MIDLIFE, NESH helps smash the unimaginable syncopation that no Hero could face alone, hoping to at least prove to the world that he is the most in the pocket HERO there is!",
